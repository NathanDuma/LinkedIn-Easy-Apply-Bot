# LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot
This repository is based off of Nathan Duma's because it wasn't updated in a while and LI's constantly introducing new interface changes.

Without Nathan, I wouldn't have a repository to copy and update. Thanks to the original author.

The rest of the readme is from the original:

Automatically apply to LinkedIn Easy Apply jobs. This bot answers the application questions as well!

This is for educational purposes only. I am not responsible if your LinkedIn account gets suspended or for anything else.

This bot is written in Python using Selenium.

## Setup 

To run the bot, open the command line in the cloned repo directory and install the requirements using pip with the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, you need to fill out the config.yaml file. Most of this is self-explanatory but if you need explanations please see the end of this README.
